**The factory pattern comes under the creational patterns**. It provides one of the best ways to create an object. In factory pattern, objects are created without exposing the logic to client and referring to the newly created object using a common interface.

Factory patterns are implemented in Python using factory method. When a user calls a method such that we pass in a string and the return value as a new object is implemented through factory method. The type of object used in factory method is determined by string which is passed through method.
